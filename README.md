# Design for Performance and Scalability

---

In this project, I planned, designed, provisioned, and monitored infrastructure in AWS using industry-standard and open source tools. I practiced the skills learnt throughout the course to optimize infrastructure for cost and performance. I also used Terraform to provision and configure AWS services in a global configuration.
