RDS pricing – reduced storage amount and additional backup storage,,,,,,,
EC2 pricing (both web and application servers) changed from On-Demand to standard reserved for 1-year paid upfront,,,,,,,
s3 monthly storage reduced,,,,,,,
Application Load Balancer – reduced amount of processed GB per month (EC2 and IP),,,,,,,
Network Load Balancer - reduces number of processed GB per month (NLB for TCP),,,,,,,
Cloudwatch – reduced number of basic checks within AWS and Elastic Network Interfaces,,,,,,,
